ClassConnect Project Report

Introduction
ClassConnect is a platform that bridges the gap between students and tutors, enabling seamless 
peer-to-peer academic support. With features like tutor profiles, real-time virtual sessions, and 
intelligent scheduling, the platform fosters effective collaboration. My role in the project 
centered on developing a robust search and match system to help students quickly find tutors 
who best meet their academic needs.
Problem
One key challenge faced during development was the inefficiency in connecting students with 
suitable tutors. Without a tailored search system, users were overwhelmed with irrelevant or 
generic results, making it difficult to identify the right match. For instance, students seeking 
subject-specific assistance often struggled to filter tutors based on expertise, availability, or 
ratings. This lack of precision reduced the platform's usability and overall user satisfaction.
Solution
To address this issue, I developed an intelligent search and match system using an algorithm 
designed to rank and prioritize results based on relevance. The system considered multiple 
factors, including tutor expertise, user ratings, availability, and subject alignment. Filters such as 
subject area, experience level, and preferred session format (e.g., video or chat) were introduced 
to enhance the search experience further.
Implementation Details
The search system was built using [specific technologies, e.g., Python and Elasticsearch] to 
ensure fast and accurate querying. A ranking algorithm was implemented to prioritize results, 
and dynamic filters were developed using JavaScript for real-time adjustments. Data on tutor 
profiles and session history was stored in a relational database, enabling efficient crossreferencing during searches.
Challenges
A primary challenge was optimizing the algorithm to ensure fast query response times while 
managing a growing database of user profiles. Additionally, integrating dynamic filters with live 
data required careful synchronization between the frontend and backend systems.
Impact
The search and match system significantly improved the platform's usability. Feedback from beta 
testing showed that 90% of users found relevant matches within their first three searches, 
reducing the time spent finding a tutor by over 50%. The feature also contributed to increased 
user engagement, as students were more likely to book sessions when they could easily identify 
suitable tutors.
Conclusion and Future Work
The search and match system has become a cornerstone of the ClassConnect platform, delivering
precise results and improving user satisfaction. Future plans include leveraging AI to suggest 
tutors based on past interactions and integrating machine learning to improve ranking accuracy 
over time
