Report on a Key Challenge and Resolution
Problem: Managing Concurrent Updates in Class Management

Description:
With the ability for teachers and students to create, join, and manage classes, handling simultaneous actions (e.g., multiple students joining a class or teachers updating class details) presented challenges in maintaining data consistency and preventing conflicts.

Challenges Faced:

Concurrency Issues:

Multiple users performing actions on the same class (e.g., joining or editing) could lead to race conditions or overwriting of data.
Data Integrity:

Ensuring that class rosters, updates, and assignments remained consistent across all users.
Real-Time Updates:

Providing users with live updates on class changes without delays or conflicts.
System Performance:

Balancing real-time updates and heavy traffic during peak periods.
Approach Taken:

Locking Mechanisms:

Implemented optimistic locking to prevent simultaneous updates from overwriting each other. If a conflict occurred, the system prompted users to retry.
Real-Time Sync:

Used WebSocket technology to enable real-time updates for all participants in a class.
Transaction Management:

Ensured all database changes related to class management were handled within atomic transactions to maintain data consistency.
Load Balancing:

Deployed load balancing strategies to handle high traffic efficiently during peak times (e.g., when many students join a class simultaneously).
Testing and Monitoring:

Simulated high-concurrency scenarios during testing to identify and resolve bottlenecks and edge cases.
Outcome:

Data conflicts were minimized through locking and transaction management.
Real-time updates improved the user experience by keeping everyone informed of class changes instantly.
Performance optimizations ensured smooth handling of concurrent user actions, even during high-traffic periods.
This solution provided a scalable and reliable system for class management.
